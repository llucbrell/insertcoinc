#Insert Coinc

This is a connect 4 game written in JavaScript.
The grid of the game has drawn over a canvas, for a better integration with my own drawings.

The engine and the grid files are designed for being future feature. Otherwise the file views is still very simple and it'll be changed for better animations in the future.

The subject of the game is a pigGridGame that loves eat coins... Reds.. or Yellows!
